First of all, I'll briefly describe the goal of this project. After graduation from college, I directed my career in finance where I've worked for 7 years.
From the audit, financial advisory to investment banking, and private equity I can pretty much say that I've seen it all. To be honest it's not something that I would recommend. 

Generating money from one pile to another without real added value is something that doesn't make the world a better place it's something that provides wealth to a
a small group of already wealthy and sad individuals. Investing my time in the sole purpose of the finance world is a waste of time. Money shouldn't be the main goal of doing anything because at the end of the day it doesn't have any underlying value. It doesn't make the world a better place. Of course, reading this from your perspective is something like "Of course you to this conclusion I should jump before I started working in the finance sector". Well, you are probably right but life situations sometimes put you in a position where you are not able to choose your path, you do things that are necessary to survive. Nevertheless, I will share my experience with you all who are willing to not make the same mistakes or go to misleading fields. Having realized that I've decided to spin-off my career path into IT and software development which I'm sure will at the end of the day generate added value and make the world a better place.

Having some useful education in the field of mathematics am starting here with my small project of cod development and directing my career into IT. Please give me constructive feedback and support. Thru this project, I'll also try to motivate others to be brave and decided to quit their career in sectors that don't have added value, that doesn't make them happy, the jobs that don't make the world a better place.
